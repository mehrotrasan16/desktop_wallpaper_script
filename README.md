# desktop_wallpaper_script
A piece of software whose function is to change your wallpaper to a regularly updated calendar everyday.

# Structure
Two parts
  1 - A C# script to set the wallpaper (Because I thought Programming for windows is easier in C#)
  2 - A C# or Python Script to manually update an excel calendar template, screenshot it, and call the above script.
 
Figuring out whether programmingin excel is easier in C# or in Python. Open to exploring other options that could make the job easier.
